Ubuntu announced its 6.06 Server release almost 5 years ago, on June 1,
2006.  For the LTS Server releases, Ubuntu committed to ongoing
security and critical fixes for a period of 5 years. The support
period is now nearing its end and Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server will reach 
end of life on Wednesday, June 1, 2011. At that time, Ubuntu Security
Notices will no longer include information or updated packages for
Ubuntu 6.06.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server is via 
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Server.  Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may 
be found at  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades. 
For further Ubuntu support, including commercial support options, see
http://www.ubuntu.com/support.
 
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Server continues to be actively supported with 
security updates and select high-impact bug fixes. All announcements 
of official security updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to 
the ubuntu-security-announce mailing list, information about which 
may be found at
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce.

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.
